Digital Footprints: Your digital footprints can also serve as an alibi. This could include phone records, GPS data, or even your online activity.\n\n5. Legal Representation: Hire a competent lawyer who can help you present your alibi in the most convincing way possible. They can guide you through the legal process and ensure that your rights are protected.\n\n6. Consistency: Ensure that your alibi is consistent and does not change.

The decoy should be able to move in some way to mimic your movements and distract the illusions.\n\n2. Technological Decoy: Use technology to create a more convincing decoy. This could involve using a holographic projector to create a 3D image of yourself. The hologram should be able to move and behave like you to fool the illusions.\n\n3. Heat Signature: Illusions in the Mirage Maze might be able to detect heat signatures. To fool them, you could equip your decoy with a heat source to mimic your body heat.\n\n4. Sound Mimicry: The illusions might also be able to detect sound. Record your voice and other sounds you make and play them back through a speaker in the decoy.\n\n5. Scent Mimicry: If the illusions can detect scent, use your own scent on the decoy. This could be done by wearing the decoy's clothes for a while before entering the maze, or by using a scent-mimicking spray.\n\n6. Movement: Program the decoy to move randomly throughout the maze.

This could be done by using Illusoria's inherent magic to create a convincing illusion of a powerful entity or a catastrophic event threatening the realm. \n\n2. **Creating a Doppelganger**: Simultaneously, one would need to create a doppelganger of themselves.
