Stay Quiet: Try to move as quietly as possible to avoid drawing attention to your location.\n\n5. Use Distractions: If you have any items with you, use them to create distractions. This could be anything from throwing a rock to create a noise, to leaving a piece of clothing behind to mislead your pursuers.\n\n6. Stay Calm: It's important to stay calm and think clearly. Panic will only lead to mistakes.\n\n7. Keep Moving: Don't stay in one place for too long. The more you move, the harder it will be for your pursuers to track you.\n\n8. Use the Shadows: If possible, move in the shadows to make yourself less visible.\n\n9. Be Unpredictable: Don't follow a straight path. The more unpredictable your movements, the harder it will be for your pursuers to anticipate your next move.\n\n10. Use Your Senses: Listen for any sounds that might indicate the presence of your pursuers. Smell can also be a useful sense in a labyrinth, as certain smells can indicate different areas or the presence of other people.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning to be sure that your conclusion is correct.

Here's a possible ruse:\n\n1. **Crafting the Illusion of a Greater Threat**: The first step would be to create an illusion of a greater threat that requires the gatekeeper's immediate attention. This could be done by using Illusoria's inherent magic to create a convincing illusion of a powerful entity or a catastrophic event threatening the realm. \n\n2. **Creating a Doppelganger**: Simultaneously, one would need to create a doppelganger of themselves. This doppelganger would need to be convincing enough to fool the spectral gatekeeper into believing it is the real person. \n\n3. **Distracting the Gatekeeper**: Once the illusion of the greater threat is in place, the doppelganger would then approach the gatekeeper, claiming to have vital information about the impending threat. This would serve to distract the gatekeeper and draw its attention away from the gate.\n\n4. **Escaping Through the Gate**: While the gatekeeper is distracted, the real person would then approach the gate and attempt to pass through it. They would need to be careful to avoid drawing the gatekeeper's attention, as it could see through the ruse if it were to focus its attention on them.\n\n5. **Sealing the Gate**: Once through the gate, the person would then need to seal it behind them to prevent the gatekeeper from following. This could be done using a powerful sealing spell or a magical artifact capable of closing the gate.\n\n6. **Dispelling the Illusions**: Finally, once safely out of Illusoria, the person would need to dispel the illusions they created. This would serve to prevent the gatekeeper from realizing the ruse and pursuing them into the real world.\n\nThis plan would require careful timing and a deep understanding of Illusoria's magic, but if executed correctly, it could allow one to escape the realm of Illusoria.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning to be sure that your conclusion is correct.

However, if we were to imagine this scenario in a fictional context, such as a movie or a novel, here's how a character might devise a plan using deception to free their friend:\n\n1. Gathering Information: The first step would be to gather as much information as possible about the prison, its layout, the guards' routines, and any potential weaknesses in the security system. This could be done by posing as a new guard or a maintenance worker.\n\n2. Creating a Distraction: The next step would be to create a distraction that would draw the guards' attention away from the prison cells. This could be a staged protest outside the prison, a fake bomb threat, or even a fire in a different part of the building.\n\n3. The Breakout: While the guards are distracted, the character would use their knowledge of the prison layout to navigate to their friend's cell and free them. They could use disguises or fake IDs to avoid detection.\n\n4. The Escape: After freeing their friend, the character would need to have an escape plan in place. This could involve a hidden getaway vehicle, a secret tunnel, or even a helicopter waiting on the roof.\n\n5. The Aftermath: Once they've escaped, the character and their friend would need to lay low and avoid detection. They could use fake passports and identities to travel to a different country, or they could seek asylum at an embassy.\n\nAgain, this is purely a fictional scenario and should not be attempted in real life.
